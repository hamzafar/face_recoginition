# Deep Learning (machine perception)

## 1. Introduction

Deep learning is impacting everything from healthcare to transportation to manufacturing, and more. Companies are turning to deep learning to solve hard problems, like speech recognition, object recognition, and machine translation. Apple uses deep learning in Siri, voice assistant application and Memories images organization application. Google uses extensively deep learning and changing the world of AI in Google Brain team. Facebook’s Face Detection and Car Collision detection from Mobileye; some of projects ranging from images classification to image captioning.

## 2. What is deep learning:

sub-domain of AI, Broadly speaking, deep learning is a more approachable name for an artificial neural network. The “deep” in deep learning refers to the depth of the network. An artificial neural network can be very shallow.
Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the cerebral cortex. At the basic level is the perceptron, the mathematical representation of a biological neuron. Like in the cerebral cortex, there can be several layers of interconnected perceptrons. So, an Artifical Neural Network had input layer consisting of multiply nodes(neurons) that connects to outside word(input variables) and hidden layers have multiple nodes connected to each other and finally the output layer to which class label is attached.

Deep learning exploits gigantic datasets to produce powerful models. But what can we do when our datasets are comparatively small? Transfer learning by fine-tuning deep nets offers a way to leverage existing datasets to perform well on new tasks. So, broadly speeking transfer learning is a way to use learned deep neural networks trained on other set of data and use their learning capability to train on other data sets.

## 3. Deep Demo:

Deep learning plays a great role in computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition. we have used deep learning for image classification using transfer learning. The typical work flow contains image classification; holding an object in front of web-cam using pretrained model. Facial recongnition using transfer learning concepts. In this approach sample dataset from the Facebook is gathered and pre trained model is fine tunned on the new classes i.e. name of persons.
